ConcordanceA concordance is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its immediate context. Concordances have been compiled only for works of special importance, such as the Vedas,[1] Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare, James Joyce or classical Latin and Greek authors,[2] because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-computer era.
